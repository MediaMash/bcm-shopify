The file structure and architecture of a Shopify app can vary based on your app's complexity and technology stack. However, here's a simplified file structure and architecture for a basic Shopify app:

bcm-shopify-plugin/

├── app/
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── auth.py
│   │   ├── shopify.py
│   │   ├── video.py

│   │   ├── video.py

```

Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- **app/controllers**: This directory contains your application's controllers, which handle HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate services. For example, you might have a `video.py` controller to manage video-related actions.

- **app/models**: This directory contains your application's data models, defining how data is structured and stored. You might have models for videos, products, users, and more.

- **app/services**: Services contain the business logic of your app. For example, a `video_service.py` might handle interactions with video data and perform CRUD operations.

- **app/templates**: This directory stores your HTML templates. You'll typically have templates for the app's admin interface and public-facing components.

- **app/static**: This is where you store your static assets, such as CSS and JavaScript files.

- **migrations**: If you're using a database, this directory contains database migration scripts.

- **tests**: This directory contains your application's test suites.

- **config.py**: Configuration settings for your app, such as database connections and environment variables.

- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python packages and dependencies required for your app. You can generate this file with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

- **.env**: Environment variables for sensitive data like API keys and secrets. Ensure this file is securely managed and not committed to version control.

- **.gitignore**: A file that specifies which files and directories should be ignored by version control (e.g., `.env`, database files).

- **README.md**: Documentation for your app, including instructions for installation, usage, and any other relevant information.
